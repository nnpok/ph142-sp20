Helpful hints:

-  Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit right before submitting**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file. When it doesn't, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

**[12 points] Part 1: Simulating birth defect data and sampling from an infinitely large population** 

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in every
33 infants is born with a birth defect in the United States each year.

1) [3 points] Define a random variable for "birth defect". Write down the probability model for the random variable. Round each percentage to two decimal places (e.g., 0.43224 
would be rounded to 43.22%). Is the sample space discrete or continuous?

<TODO: Replace the text with your list of proportions and your explanation.>

You might want to use the table template below to write out your probability 
model. If not, then delete it. *Knit now* to see how this table is rendered in your PDF.

| Tables   |      Are     |  Cool |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| yadi     | type stuff   | X     |
| yadi     | more stuff   | Y     |
| yada     | etc          | Z     |

 

\newpage

2) [2 points] Simulate data that equals 0 if there is no birth defect and equals
1 if there is a birth defect. Simulate this data for 200 births at a local 
hospital. Be sure to use the risk of birth defect from part a). Assign your 
simulated output the name `sim_01`. Print your simulated births 
to the screen.

Before you run your simulation, we will "set the seed". We all will set the seed
to 100. This means that everyone's simulation will yield the exact same dataset.
```{r set-seed}
set.seed(100) 
# execute this line before you write your simulation code.
# only execute the set.seed() function one time. 
```

```{r simulate-200-births}
sim_01 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sim_01
check_problem2()
```

Notice that `sim_01` is not a data frame, rather it is a vector of numbers. The 
following code stores `sim_01` as a data frame and changes its variable name. 
Run this code and view `sim_01` in the Viewer pane.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
sim_01 <- as.data.frame(sim_01) # watch what happens to sim_01 in your environment
names(sim_01) # prints the variable names in the sim_01 data frame
sim_01 <- sim_01 %>% rename(birth_defect = sim_01)
```

\newpage

3) [2 points] Write code to determine the number of birth defects that occurred in your 
simulation, and the corresponding proportion with birth defects. Assign your 
output the name `output_01`. Print `output_01` to the screen. Hint: Use `dplyr` functions
to do this.

```{r, problem-3}
output_01 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_01
check_problem3()
```

\newpage

4) [2 marks] Re-run your simulation four more times and assign the output to a unique 
name each time. Print to the screen the number and proportion after each run. 
(Basically, "recycle" the code above four times)

```{r, problem-4}
sim_02 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_02 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_02
sim_03 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_03 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_03
sim_04 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_04 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_04
sim_05 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_05 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
output_05
check_problem4()
```

\newpage

5) [1 mark] Assign the vector p5 to the simulated proportions from each of your five
simulation in *increasing* order.

```{r, problem-5}
p5 <- c("YOUR ANSWER HERE")
p5
check_problem5()
```

\newpage

6) [1 mark] Did you get close to the true value? Explain why there is variation in the proportions across the simulations.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


\newpage

7) [1 mark] Suppose that rather than simulating 5 samples of size 200, we simulated 5 samples
of size 1000. In 1-2 sentences, how would you expect the group of proportion 
estimates from part e) to be different? Comment both on the accuracy of these 
values at predicting the true value, and their variance. If you're not sure, you
can re-run your simulation with a larger sample size and see how the results 
change to deduct the difference.

**[8 points] Part 2: Probability of HIV and Hepatitis C**

Approximately 1.1 million Americans have HIV and 3.5 million Americans have 
Hepatitis C (HCV). The number of individuals with coinfection (e.g., both HIV 
and HCV) is 300,000. Among individuals with HIV, approximately 25% have 
Hepatitis C. The total US population was approximately 321 million at the time 
of these statistics.

\newpage

8) [2 points] Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen American will have HIV. 
Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen American will have HCV. Convert
to percentages and round to two decimal places. Save these values as the vector p2a with the proportion for HIV first then HCV. Don't inclue the % in your answer.

```{r, problem-2a}
p8 <- c("YOUR ANSWER HERE")
p8
check_problem8()
```



\newpage

9) [2 points] Without using the number of co-infections provided in the question,
calculate the probability that someone will have both HIV and HCV. Convert to a percent rounded to two decimal places and save to object p2b. Don't include the percent in your answer.
```{r, problem-2b}
p9 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
p9
check_problem9()
```


\newpage

10) [2 points] Are HIV and HCV infections independent? Show work to support your 
answer. Uncomment your selection.

```{r, problem-10}
#p10 <- "independent"
#p10 <- "not independent"
check_problem10()
```



\newpage

11) [2 points] In general, does P(A|B) equal P(B|A)? Calculate P(HIV | HCV) and
report whether or not it is equal to P(HCV | HIV).

**[9 points] part 3: Screening for lung cancer**

Background reading: Read pages 258-261 (and optionally 261-264) of Baldi & 
Moore, Edition 4. (For earlier editions, look for the section on diagnostic 
testing in medicine or on screening which covers sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value, and positive predictive value). 

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
Researchers examined the idea of testing all Medicare-enrolled heavy smokers for
lung cancer with a computed tomography (CT) scan every year. In this population, 
the lifetime chance of developing lung cancer is high. In any given year, 
approximately 3% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer. The CT scan positively
identifies lung cancer 89% of the time, and it gives a negative results for 93% 
of individuals who do not have lung cancer.

\newpage

12) [3 points] Use probability notation to express the three proabilities cited. Make sure to  
define each event using a capital letter (or two). Provide the terminology for the 89% and 
93% values based on your readings.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>



\newpage



13) [3 points] What percent of CT scans in this target population would be positive? Answer
this question by making either a probability tree or using absolute frequencies. 
Show your work.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>

<Note: If you are writing your solutions in R markdown you may want to upload an image of a
hand-drawn tree diagram (this is optional). If so use the following code, or 
delete if not using. Be sure to remove the option "eval = F" if using this code 
or it won't run when you knit the file!:>

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", eval=F}
library(knitr)
#include_graphics("src/your-scans-name.jpg")
# Once you replace the above line with your file's name (after uploading the file
# to datahub's Image sub-directory) you can execute the line of code and 
# verify that the tree diagram is printed below the code chunk.
```




\newpage

14) [1 point] We will now solve for the probability that a Medicare-enrolled heavy smoker who gets a positive scan actually has lung cancer. Write out the probability statement for
this amount. 

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>




15) [1 point] Calculate the probability value from question 14 based on your previous work from question 13. Store the answer as a 
percentage rounded to one decimal place in the object p15.


```{r}
p15 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
p15
check_problem15()
```



16) [1 point] What term from your reading does this value represent? 
Store the answer in object p16.

```{r}
p16 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
p16
check_problem16
check_problem16()
```

### Submission

For assignments in this class, you'll be submitting using the **Terminal** tab in the pane below. In order for the submission to work properly, make sure that:

1. Any image files you add that are needed to knit the file are in the `src` folder and file paths are specified accordingly. 
2. You **have not changed the file name** of the assignment.
3. The file is saved (the file name in the tab should be **black**, not red with an asterisk).
4. The file knits properly.

Once you have checked these items, you can proceed to submit your assignment.

1. Click on the **Terminal** tab in the pane below.
2. Copy-paste the following line of code into the terminal and press enter.

cd; cd ph142-sp20/hw/hw04; python3 turn_in.py

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Gradescope username and password. When entering your password, you won't see anything come up on the screen--don't worry! This is just for security purposes--just keep typing and hit enter.
4. If the submission is successful, you should see "Submission successful!" appear as output.
5. If the submission fails, try to diagnose the issue using the error messages--if you have problems, post on Piazza. 

The late policy will be strictly enforced, **no matter the reason**, including submission issues, so be sure to submit early enough to have time to diagnose issues if problems arise.
