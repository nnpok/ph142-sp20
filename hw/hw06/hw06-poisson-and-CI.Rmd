Helpful hints:

-  Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit right before submitting**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file. When it doesn't, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

Oklahoma is not historically known for experiencing earthquakes. Up until 
2008, Oklahoma experienced a constant rate of about 1.5 perceptible earthquakes
per year on average.

1. [1 point] Assuming that earthquakes are random and independent, with a 
constant rate of 1.5 per year, the count of perceptible earthquakes per year in 
Oklahoma should have a Poisson distribution with mean 1.5. What is the standard 
deviation of the number of earthquakes per year? Round to the nearest 3 decimal places.

```{r calculate-sd}
sd_earthquake <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sd_earthquake

check_problem1()
```

2. [1 point] Making the same assumptions as in part (a), use one or two R functions to 
compute the probability of seeing less than two earthquakes per year. Round your answer to three decimal places.

```{r earthquake-prob}
probability <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
probability


check_problem2()

```

3. [2 points] Do the same calculation as above, this time using only a hand 
calculator. Show your work and round your final percentage to two decimal places.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>



4. [1 point] In 2013, Oklahoma experienced 109 perceptible earthquakes (an 
average of two per week). Assuming the same model as above, write an equation to
show how the chance of experience 109 earthquakes or more can be written as a 
function of the probability at or below some $k$. 

(Note: You can write these equations using pen and paper and upload the image if
you'd like. You can also write the equations using plain text (i.e., P(X >= k)).
If you would like to use math equations that render when you knit the pdf 
(i.e., $P(X>=k)$) you need to be **very careful** with your symbols. For example, to get the symbol for "greater than or equal to" you cannot copy and paste it into R from the slides or another document. This will cause errors! Instead you need to
write $P(X \geq k)$. Again, use any of these three methods (hand-written, plain
text in R, or "math equations between dollar signs", and you will get points 
so long as it is human-readable.) 

<Note: If you are uploading an image (this is optional), use the following code, or delete if not using.BE SURE TO REMOVE THE OPTION "eval = F" if using this code OR IT WON'T RUN when you knit the file!:>

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", eval=F}
library(knitr)
#include_graphics("src/your-scans-name.jpg")
# Once you replace the above line with your file's name (after uploading the file
# to datahub's Image sub-directory) you can execute the line of code and 
# verify that the image is printed below the code chunk.
```

5. [1 point] Using R, calculate the probability of observing 109 perceptible 
earthquakes or more. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

```{r earthquake-109}
probability_109_or_more <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
probability_109_or_more

check_problem5()
```

6. [1 point] Based on your answer to Problem 5, write a sentence describing the chance of seeing such an event assuming the specified Poisson distribution (i.e., is it rare or common?)

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


7. [2 points] Based on your answer in question (e), would you conclude that the 
mean number of perceptible earthquakes has increased? Why or why not? Would 
knowing that the number of perceptible earthquakes was 585 in 2014 support your 
conclusion?

To track epidemics, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention requires 
physicians to report all cases of important transmissible diseases. In 2014,
a total of 350,062 cases of gonorrhea were officially reported, 53% of which 
were individuals in their 20s. Assume this 53% stays the same every year.
Researchers plan to take a simple random sample of 400 diagnosed cases of 
gonorrhea to study the risk factors associated with the disease. Call $\hat{p}$
the proportion of cases in the sample corresponding to individuals in their 20s. 

8 [1 point] What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400?

```{r sampling-dist-mean}
sampling_dist_mean <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sampling_dist_mean

check_problem8()
```


9. [1 point] What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400? Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r sampling-dist-sd}
sampling_dist_sd <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sampling_dist_sd

check_problem9()
```


10. [3 points] Describe the conditions required for the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ to be Normally distributed. Use the numbers provided in the question to check if the conditions are likely met.

Read [this short article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html)
in the New York Times Upshot from 2016. (All Berkeley students should have access to a free NY Times subscription.)

11. [2 points] Explain sampling variation, in the context of this article. Does the 3 percentage point margin of error account for sampling variation?

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


12. [1 point] The authors provides several reasons why the true margin of error is larger than three percent. Describe one of the primary reasons provided in 1-2 sentences.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


13. [1 point] Based on the information in article, if we're doing a study in public health, choose the answer that is most correct:

    (a) The confidence interval accounts for random error only. If a study suffers
    from other sources of bias (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement) the CI will
    not account for this limitation.
    (b) Increasing the sample size will reduce the chance of other sources of bias
    (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement), which is why a larger sample is better.
    (c) both (a) and (b)
    d) neither (a) or (b)

Assign your letter choice as a string. Example: nytimes_answer <- "c"
```{r nytimes-answer}
nytimes_answer <- "REPLACE WITH a, b, c, or d. Keep the quotes"
nytimes_answer

check_problem13()

Deer mice are small rodents native in North America. Their adult body lengths (excluding tail) are known to vary approximately Normally, with mean $\mu=86$ mm and standard deviation $\sigma=8$ mm. It is suspected that depending on their  environment, deer mice may adapt and deviate from these usual lengths. A random  sample of $n=14$ deer mice in a rich forest habitat gives an average body length  of $\bar{x}=91.1$ mm. Assume that the standard deviation $\sigma$ of all deer mice in this area is 8 mm. 

14. [1 point] Calculate a 99% confidence interval based on this information (you can use R as a calculator to perform the calculation, or use a hand calculator). Round your final values to three decimal places.

```{r CI99-rodents}
lower_tail <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
upper_tail <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND"
ci_99 <- c(lower_tail, upper_tail)

check_problem14()
```

15. [1 point] Interpret the confidence interval from Problem 14.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


16. [2 points] Suppose deer mice researchers thought your CI was too wide to be 
useful. Given that you cannot change the standard deviation, what two things 
could you do to provide a narrower confidence interval? 

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


17. [1 point] You decide to create a 95% confidence interval, rather than a 99% 
confidence interval. Perform this calculation below and round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r CI95-rodents}
lower_tail95 <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
upper_tail95 <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND"
ci_95 <- c(lower_tail95, upper_tail95)

check_problem17()
```

18. [2 points]  Based on this 95% CI, is there evidence against the hypothesis 
$H_0$ that these mice have a significantly different mean length compared to the 
population described in the first part of the question? 
Without performing a calculation, what amounts do you know the p-value to be 
bounded between for a two-sided hypothesis test of $H_0$? 

Hint: 
Use information from question 17 and from question 14.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


We want to perform a z-test with the two-sided alternative hypothesis the true mean length is not equal to 86mm. In the next four problems, we will conduct a z-test step by step.

19. [1 point] Write out the null and alternative hypotheses for the above problem using notation.

<TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE>


20. [1 point] Calculate the z test statistic. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r calc-z-stat}
z_stat <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
z_stat

check_problem20()
```


21. [1 point] Calculate the p-value as a decimal. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r calc-p-val}
p_val <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
p_val

check_problem21()
```


22. [1 point] Interpret your above p-value.

1. Any image files you add that are needed to knit the file are in the `src` folder and file paths are specified accordingly. 
2. You **have not changed the file name** of the assignment.
3. The file is saved (the file name in the tab should be **black**, not red with an asterisk).
4. The file knits properly.

Once you have checked these items, you can proceed to submit your assignment.

1. Click on the **Terminal** tab in the pane below.
2. Copy-paste the following line of code into the terminal and press enter.

cd; cd ph142-sp20/hw/hw06; python3 turn_in.py

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Gradescope username and password. When entering your password, you won't see anything come up on the screen--don't worry! This is just for security purposes--just keep typing and hit enter.
4. If the submission is successful, you should see "Submission successful!" appear as output.
5. If the submission fails, try to diagnose the issue using the error messages--if you have problems, post on Piazza. 

The late policy will be strictly enforced, **no matter the reason**, including submission issues, so be sure to submit early enough to have time to diagnose issues if problems arise.
